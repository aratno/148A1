CSC148-Assignment-1
This is the first assignment in an introductory computer science class at the University of Toronto.

The task is to code the environment for a game called Subtract Squares, which is played as follows:
<ol>
<li>A positive whole number is randomly chosen as the starting value by some neutral entity. In our case, the computer will choose it randomly.
<li>The player whose turn it is chooses some square of a positive whole number (such as 1, 4, 9, 16, . . . ) to subtract from the value, provided the chosen square is not larger. After subtracting, we have a new value and the next player chooses a square to subtract from it.
<li>Play continues to alternate between the two players until no moves are possible. Whoever is about to play at that point loses!
</ol>
